    <description>This package contains the official Microsoft.Xrm.Tooling.Connector assembly and has been authored by the Microsoft Dynamics CRM SDK team.</description>
    <summary>Core assembly required to develop managed code applications using the Xrm Tooling Connector.</summary>
    <releaseNotes>This package contains assemblies from the December 2016 update for Dynamics 365 (online and on-premises). These assemblies require application development using the Microsoft .NET Framework 4.5.2 or later.

8.2.0.5:
 Fix to memory leak in Microsoft.Xrm.Tooling.Connector.TraceLoggerBase.  Trace Listener collection would not be released within a process over a very long time frame over multiple connections. This would manifest as increasing memory consumption over a very long period. 
 Fix cleans this up on the .dispose() call on the CrmServiceClient. 
 Note: if you have built your own logger based on the Microsoft.Xrm.Tooling.Connector.TraceLoggerBase, you must call .dispose() when you are done with it to clean up the listener collection assigned to it.

8.2.0.4:
Added:
 Added Support for United Kingdom CRM GEO

 Added new behavior to DynamicsFileLogTraceListener.  You can now specify a rolling log behavior based on log size.  To enabled this, add the MaxFileSize key set to the size in bytes and the MaxFileCount set to the max number of files to the Microsoft.Xrm.Tooling.Connector.DynamicsFileLogTraceListener in your app.config. 

8.2.0.2: Fix of dependency issue in nuget package. Now properly requires .net 4.5.2 as a baseline
8.2.0.1: Assembly version changed to 2.2.0.0
Fixes: 
  Connection String support:
    Corrected issues with connection string login to properly support the "never prompt" behavior.
    Corrected issue were the connector would create a new instance of the connection unnecessarily – impacted ONLY connection string process.
    RequireNewInstance=True will now properly create a unique connection instance, RequireNewInstance = false, will now properly reuse the cached instance of the connection,  default is ‘false’ 

  Streamlined re-use of existing connection code when a new instance is called for by a constructor to remove unnecessary calls.
  Modified Caching support to return the full object from in memory cache vs just the core connection. 
  Fixed token cache behavior to work properly when assembly is resident on an Azure WebApp or Function.
  Fixed ADAL nuget dependency issue to allow assembly to consumed directly from nuget into an Azure function. 
  Fixed MFA ( multifactor authentication ) to properly handle password expired, and password to MFA scenarios

Added:
  New Function Utility.GetOrgnameAndOnlineRegionFromServiceUri, Used to parse a Org URL for the correct online region and org name. 
  CrmServiceClient now implements IDisposable to allow for the object to be explicitly disposed.

8.1.0.1: Updated to a newer version of Microsoft.IdentityModel.Clients.ActiveDirectory as required by the Xrm Tooling assemblies
8.1.0: CRM Online 2016 Update 1
8.1-preview: Pre-release CRM Online 2016 Update 1
